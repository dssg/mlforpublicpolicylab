## Project Proposal
The proposal should be 4-5 pages (pdf) and should contain:

- Background and Goals
  - what is the problem you're solving?
  - why is it important?
  - what impact will your solution have?
  - who cares about this problem?
  - who will take action based on your work
  - what are the policy goals you care about (efficiency, equity, effectiveness,…)? How will you decide on tradeoffs across these goals?
- How this problem is solved today/previously
- What interventions exist/will exist
- What data do you have and what additional data will you need?
  - **Important: You should do data exploration and provide descriptive stats to show that you have enough relevant data to solve this problem**
- What analysis are you proposing to do?
  - What is the ML problem? What are some possible outcome variables (labels) that you might use?
- How will you validate it in the class project? What metrics will you use? Why will those metrics achieve the goal you described above?
- What additional validation will need to be done later?
- What are some ethical considerations here around privacy, equity, transparency, and accountability? How do you plan on dealing with them?
- Caveats (due to data limitations, analysis limitations, time limitations, etc.)
- Policy recommendations: what kind of recommendations do you hope to give to policymakers based on this analysis/project. How will you validate whether what you are proposing will have the desired impact?

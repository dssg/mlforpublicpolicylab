## Project Update Presentations
By this week, your group should have a preliminary set of “correct but crappy” results reflecting a relatively simple model grid and the features you prioritized to build as a first pass.

**Due Monday, Oct 25:** Weekly project update with validation splits, matrices, and “version 0” results.

This  week,  each  group  will  give  a  presentation  about  the  current  status  of  their  project, covering the problem setting, approach, and initial results.  The presentations will be split between the Tuesday and Thursday Sessions. On Wednesday, we’ll continue our group check-ins and sometime this week we’ll hold an additional tech session with a deep dive on building modeling pipelines.

The mid-term progress presentation should provide a status update on your work so far as well as your plans for the next steps in your project. The presentation should be clear, well-organized, and at appropriate level of depth for the decision makers relevant to your project (as opposed to ML experts).


### Guidelines for Presentations:

Please keep your presentation to 10 minutes and provide a link to the recording in the spreadsheet listed on canvas for your classmates to access.

#### Content and timing:

- What problem are you solving and why is it important? Be specific about goals and scope and available data (at a high level) for addressing it (1 minute)

- Analytical formulation (3 minutes):
  - what is the overall formulation?
  - what are rows, cohort, labels, and features
  - what model evaluation/selection metric are you focused on?
  - highlight any data exploration that informed these choices
  - Pipeline structure/overview

- Initial results (4 minutes):
  - V0 results for initial models (including PR-k curve)
  - results using all the baselines (also describe the baselines)

- Next steps (2 minutes):
  - Planned features
  - Model grid & selection

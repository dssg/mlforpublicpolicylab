## Project Update Presentations
By this week, your group should have a preliminary set of “correct but crappy” results reflecting a relatively simple model grid and the features you prioritized to build as a first pass.

**Due Monday, Nov 1:** Weekly project update with initial “version 0” results and a list of models and hyperparameters you'll be running.

This  week,  each  group  will  give  a  presentation  about  the  current  status  of  their  project, covering the problem setting, approach, and initial results.  The presentations will be split between the Tuesday and Thursday Sessions. On Wednesday, we’ll continue our group check-ins.

The midterm progress presentation should provide a status update on your work so far as well as your plans for the next steps in your project. The presentation should be clear, well-organized, and at appropriate level of depth for the decision makers relevant to your project (as opposed to ML experts).


### Guidelines for Presentations:

Each group will have up to 10 minutes to present plus 3 minutes for questions. Please upload a PDF of your slides to this assignment on the day of your presentation as well as a link to the google slides via Canvas.

- **Tuesday, November 2:** Bills 2, Schools 2, Turnout 1, EPA 2
- **Thursday, November 4:** Bills 1, Schools 1, Turnout 2, EPA 1

#### Content and timing:

- What problem are you solving and why is it important? Be specific about goals and scope and available data (at a high level) for addressing it (1 minute)

- Analytical formulation (4 minutes):
  - what is the overall formulation?
  - what are rows, cohort, labels, and features
  - what model evaluation/selection metric are you focused on?
  - highlight any data exploration that informed these choices
  - Pipeline structure/overview

- Initial results (3 minutes):
  - results using all the baselines (also describe the baselines)
  - v0 results for initial models (including PR-k curve)

- Next steps (2 minutes):
  - Planned features
  - Model grid & selection

## Project Work
By this week, your group should have a very simple version of an end-to-end pipeline that can generate
preliminary results for a single model specification.

**Due Friday, Oct. 9:** [Skeleton pipeline code, analytical formulation, and baselines](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/18465/assignments/297595)

## Tuesday: Performance Metrics and Evaluation, Part I ([Zoom video](https://cmu.zoom.us/rec/play/SnGljUp1WBKvDXbaiOOeVFxHmYpj2-CYxH0eZVIQmyJd73VBTAVyfI8HSES8qHMoF5K7k5gsS2O7b5Sj.9rgpGOFjOwyRLLD0) - restricted to students in class for now)
In most cases, a vast array of methods — each with a number of tunable hyperparameters —
can be brought to bear on your modeling question. How do you decide which models are better than others and how can you be confident this decision will generalize  into the future when the model is deployed? How should you balance considerations of performance (``accuracy``) and
fairness when making these decisions? Are models that are performing similarly well giving
similar predictions? What should you do if they are not? In this week, we’ll begin to answer
these questions, focusing on cross-validation stategies (beyond the often used k-fold) and choosing performance metrics.

## Wednesday Group Check-Ins
On Wednesday, we’ll start our regular group check-ins to provide feedback on your project progress.

## Thursday: Temporal Validation Deep Dive
Thursday, we’ll meet together as a class to do a deep dive on temporal validation through a few class project examples.

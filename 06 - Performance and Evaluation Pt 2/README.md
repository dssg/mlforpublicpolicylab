## Project Work
During this week, your pipeline development and refinement should continue with a widening set of model specifications and features to explore.

**Due Friday, Oct 8:** Skeleton pipeline code/triage configuration file, one-sentence analytical formulation, and baselines.

## Tuesday: Performance Metrics and Evaluation, Pt II
This week, we'll continue our discussion from the previous week, focusing specifically on validation strategies that reflect how you want your model to generalize. In particular, we'll focus on the common case of modeling contexts with a strong temporal component where predicting into the future is desired, exploring how your choice of training and validation sets can reflect this context.

Required Readings for Tuesday:

- Cross-validation strategies for data with temporal, spatial, hierarchical, or phylogenetic
structure by Roberts, DR, Bahn, V, et al. Ecography 40:2017. [Available Online](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecog.02881)

Optional Readings:

- Time Series Nested Cross-Validation by Cochrane, C. Medium. [Available Online](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-nested-cross-validation-76adba623eb9)
- Section 7 of Chapter 7 in Data and Social Science (2nd edition) edited by Foster, Ghani, et al. Chapter 7: Machine Learning. [Available Online](https://textbook.coleridgeinitiative.org/chap-ml.html)
- The Secrets of Machine Learning by Rudin, C. and Carlson, D. arXiv preprint: 1906.01998. 2019. [Available Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01998)

## Wednesday: Group Check-Ins
On Wednesday, we'll start our regular group check-ins to provide feedback on your project progress.

## Thursday: Temporal Validation Deep Dive
Thursday, weâ€™ll **meet together as a class** to do a deep dive on temporal validation through a few class project examples.

## Project Work
During this week, your pipeline development and refinement should continue with a widening set of model specifications and features to explore.

Sometime this week, we'll have a tech session on sklearn and modeling parameters.

## Tuesday: Performance Metrics and Evaluation, Pt II
On Tuesday, we’ll continue our discussion from the previous week, delving into the details of winnowing down a large number of model specifications to one or a handful that perform "best" for some definition of "best". In particular, we’ll focus on the common case of machine learning problems with a strong time series component and the desire to balance performance and stability in model selection.

Required Readings for Tuesday: 
- [Short Video on Evaluation Metrics](https://youtu.be/JsicCiQiq7E)
- *Transductive Optimization of Top k Precision* by Liu, LP, Dietterich, TG, et al. IJCAI 2016. [Available Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05976)

Highly Recommended:
- - Section 7 of Chapter 7 in Data and Social Science (2nd edition) edited by Foster, Ghani, et al. Chapter 7: Machine Learning. [Available Online](https://textbook.coleridgeinitiative.org/chap-ml.html)

Optional Readings:
- *Evaluating and Comparing Classifiers* by Stapor, K. CORES 2017. [Available Online](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59162-9_2) 

## Wednesday: Group Check-Ins

Make sure to go over the slides submitted by other teams in your project group and we'll use the wednesday sessions for each team and instructor to give feedback.

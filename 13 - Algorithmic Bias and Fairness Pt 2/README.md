**Note:** No classes on Wednesday, Nov 25, or Thursday, Nov 26, for Thanksgiving.

## Project Work
During this week, your group should be continuing to investigate any
disparities in your model results as well as performing any other
necessary post-modeling analyses. 

**Due Monday, Nov 22**: Weekly project update.

## Tuesday: Algorithmic Bias and Fairness, Part II
This week, weâ€™ll continue our discussion of bias and fairness with a
very brief survey of practical considerations and open research
questions in the rapidly-developing field.

Link to [slides for this week](FALL%2020%20-%20ethics%20bias%20fairness%20-%20part%202.pptx).

Although we won't have time to cover these in class, you may want to check out these [additional slides covering some other important topics in data & ML/AI ethics](FALL%2020%20-%20other%20ML%20ethics%20issues.pptx).

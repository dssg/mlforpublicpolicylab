## Project Work
At this point in your project work, you should be developing your initial end-to-end pipeline.

**Due Friday (Sep 25)**: [Project proposal with scope and descriptive statistics.](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/18465/assignments/268653)

## Tuesday: Machine Learning Pipelines
On Tuesday ([Lecture Slides](Machine-Learning-Pipelines.pptx)), we’ll describe the components of typical machine learning pipelines. End-to-end ML Pipelines can quickly become unwieldy with several moving pieces and well-structured, modular code is often critical to detecting and fixing bugs in the process.  This session will provide an overview of the pipeline, each underlying element, and some best practices for building them.

Required Readings for Tuesday:
- Review the lecture slides before class: [Online](https://github.com/dssg/mlforpublicpolicylab/blob/master/04%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20Pipelines/Machine-Learning-Pipelines.pptx)

Useful examples:
- [Triage](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/triage)
  - [Code on github](http://github.com/dssg/triage)
  - [Tutorial](https://dssg.github.io/triage/dirtyduck/)

Optional Reading:
- *Architecting a Machine Learning Pipeline* by Koen, S. (Medium) [Available Online](https://towardsdatascience.com/architecting-a-machine-learning-pipeline-a847f094d1c7)
- *Meet Michelangelo: Uber's Machine Learning Platform* by Hermann, J and Del Balso, M. [Available Online](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/)

## Wednesday and Thursday: Project Work
During the Wednesday and Thursday sessions, you'll have time to work with your group on the proposal due this week as well as your initial pipeline.

Optional Readings:
- *Data Analysis, Exploratory* by Brillinger. [Available Online](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~brill/Papers/EDASage.pdf)

## Project Work
At this point, your group should be continuing to refine and expand on your preliminary modeling results.  

**Due Monday, Nov. 2**: Weekly project update with fixed "version 0" results and a list of models and hyperparameters you'll be running.

## Tuesday: Model Interpretability, Part I
Model interpretability can be thought of at two levels: global (how
the model works in aggregate) and local (why an individual
prediction came out as it did). This week, weâ€™ll focus on the bigger
picture: understanding how a model is performing globally and what it
means to compare this performance across model specifications.

## Project Work
By this week, project work should be beginning to focus more heavily on evaluation, model selection, and interpretation. 

**Due Monday, Nov 8**: Weekly project update.

## Tuesday: Model Interpretability
[Lecture Slides](Interpretability%20part%201.pptx)

Model interpretability can be thought of at two levels: global (how the model works in aggregate) and local (why an individual prediction came out as it did). This week, we'll focus on some practical aspects and applications of interpretability at the two levels: understanding how a model is performing globally, what it means to compare this performance across model specifications, how these methods can help researchers debug and improve their models, build trust among stakeholders (including a growing legal movement towards a "right to explanation"), help those acting on model predictions understand when they should override the model with their judgement, and importantly help those actors decide not only on whom to intervene but suggest what sort of intervention to take.

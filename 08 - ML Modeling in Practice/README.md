## Project Work
During this week, your pipeline development and refinement should continue with a widening set of model specifications and features to explore.

**Due Monday, Oct 19**: Technical modeling plan and detailed feature list.

## Tuesday: Recap and Check-In
We'll dedicate our time this Tuesday to a recap of the class so far and check-in on progress on your projects.

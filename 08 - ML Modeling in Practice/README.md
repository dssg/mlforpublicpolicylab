## Project Work
During this week, your pipeline development and refinement should continue with a widening set of model specifications and features to explore.

**Due Monday, Oct 18**: Technical modeling plan and detailed feature list.

## Tuesday: ML Modeling in Practice
On Tuesday, we'll cover some practical tips about building machine learning models for real-world projects: how should you think about what types of models to build? What hyperparameters should you explore and how do you design a hyperparameter grid?

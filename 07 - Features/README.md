## Project Work
Pipeline development should be continuing in your project, with a focus on producing the
simplest-possible version of the full system.

**Due Friday, Oct. 2:** Peer reviews of two project proposals.

## Tuesday: Feature Engineering and Imputation
In many real-world contexts, expressing domain expertise through thoughtful feature engineering can dramatically improve model performance by understanding what underlying factors are likely to be predictive and helping the model find these relationships. Likewise,
most data sets you’ll encounter in practice are littered with outliers, inconsistencies, and missingness. Handling these data issues in a smart way can be critical to a project’s success.

Required Readings for Tuesday:
- [Short Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kluqz_1GN5c) and corresponding [slides](https://github.com/dssg/mlforpublicpolicylab/blob/master/05%20-%20Features/features-and-imputation.pptx?raw=true)


## Wednesday: Remote Workflows Tech Session
On Wednesday, the TAs will lead tutorials on remote technical workflows and using Python and SQL together.

## Thursday: Project Work
On Thursday, you'll have time to work together with your project team.

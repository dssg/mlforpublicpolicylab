## Project Work
By this week, your group should have a very simple version of an end-to-end pipeline with preliminary results for a single model specification.

**Note:** No classes on Thursday, Oct. 14 (mid-semester break).

## Tuesday: Feature Engineering and Imputation
[Lecture Slides](features-and-imputation.pptx)

In many real-world contexts, expressing domain expertise through thoughtful feature engineering can dramatically improve model performance by understanding what underlying factors are likely to be predictive and helping the model find these relationships. Likewise,
most data sets you’ll encounter in practice are littered with outliers, inconsistencies, and missingness. Handling these data issues in a smart way can be critical to a project’s success.

Required Readings for Tuesday:
- [Short Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kluqz_1GN5c) and corresponding [slides](https://github.com/dssg/mlforpublicpolicylab/blob/master/05%20-%20Features/features-and-imputation.pptx?raw=true)


## Wednesday: Group Check-Ins

## Thursday: Project Work
On Thursday, you'll have time to work together with your project team.

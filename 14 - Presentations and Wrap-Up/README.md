## Tuesday and Wednesday: Final Presentations and Wrap-Up
During this final week of classes, each group will give a presentation about their applied ML project as described in the syllabus. On Tuesday, we'll use our time to wrap up the class and briefly touch on some of the topics we didn't have time to cover (including field trials, model deployment, and monitoring/maintaining the system over time), then on Wednesday, each group will present about their results during our lab session. We won't meet on Thursday to give you time to incorporate feedback from the presentations and work together on the final report.

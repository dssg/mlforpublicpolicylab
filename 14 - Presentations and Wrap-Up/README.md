## Tuesday and Thursday: Final Presentations and Wrap-Up
During this final week of classes, each group will give a presentation about their applied ML project as described above. On Thursday, we'll use a little time to wrap up the class and briefly touch on some of the topics we didn't have time to cover (including field trials, model deployment, and monitoring/maintaining the system over time).

## Project Work
By this week, you should be wrapping up any remaining
technical work and beginning to put together results for your
group’s final report and presentation. 

**Due Monday, Nov 30**: Weekly project update.

## Tuesday: Causality and Field Validation
Even with careful planning and handling of the data, the only way to
truly understand how well your model works is by testing it in the
field. Generally, you’re concerned not only with its predictiveness,
but the actual ability of the model to help the program achieve its
policy goals, such as improving outcomes among the population it
serves. Typically, this involves working closely with policy makers to
develop a field trial using either randomization or non-experimental
methods depending on the constraints of the setting. 

Required Readings for Tuesday:
- *The seven tools of causal inference, with reflections on machine learning* by Pearl, J. Comm ACM. 2019 [Available Online](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r481.pdf)

## Wednesday: Group Check-Ins

## Thursday: Project Work

Optional Readings:
- *Elements of Causal Inference* by Peters et al. MIT Press. Chapters 1 and 2. [Available Online (Open Access Link)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference)

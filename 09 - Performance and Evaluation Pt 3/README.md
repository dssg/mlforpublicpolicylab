## Project Work
At this point, your group should be continuing to refine and expand on your preliminary modeling results.  

**Due Monday, Nov. 1**: Weekly project update with fixed "version 0" results and a list of models and hyperparameters you'll be running.

## Tuesday: Choosing Performance Metrics and Evaluating Classifiers, Part III
This week ([Lecture Slides](Model%20Selection%20and%20Validation%20-%20Part%20III.pptx)), we'll return to our discussion of model selection, delving into the details of winnowing down a large number of model specifications to one or a handful that perform "best" for some definition of "best". In particular, we'll focus on the common case of machine learning problems with a strong time series component and the desire to balance performance and stability in model selection. 

## Wednesday: Group Check-Ins

## Thursday: Project Work

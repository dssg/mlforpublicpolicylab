## Project Work
Work on your project during this week should include continuing to develop and refine your scope as you begin to explore the data. You'll also need to prepare and load some data into a database in order to make use of it in your modeling.

**Due Friday (Sep 18)**: [Data loading assignment with ACS data. Assignment and submission instructions are on canvas](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/18465/assignments/268647)

## Tuesday: Data Exploration
Tuesday ([Lecture Slides](data-exploration.pptx)) of this week will provide a crash course in exploratory data analysis.  Data exploration is fundamental to developing an understanding of the nuances of the data and how the policy problem you initially scoped can be specifically formulated as a machine learning problem.  This process involves generating and plotting summary statistics, exploring trend sover time and understanding rapid changes in distributions, as well as identifying missing data and outliers. Typically, data exploration should involve considerable input from domain experts as you develop an understanding of how the data relates to the underlying generative process, as well as its idiosyncrasies and limitations.

We'll also dedicate about 30 minutes during class on Tuesday for you to meet with your project teams and discuss your project scope.

Required Reading for Tuesday:
- *Practical Statistics for Data Scientists* by Bruce, A. and Bruce, P. O'Reilly (2017). Chapter 1: Exploratory Data Analysis [Available Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/ch01.html#EDA)

## Wednesday: Project Work and Check-ins
During the Wednesday session, you'll have time to work together with your project team to refine your scope and explore the data. We will also use this time to meet with every project team to go over project and data details.

## Thursday: Analytical Formulation and Baseline

Required Readings for Thursday:
- [Recorded Lecture Video](https://youtu.be/-whVPGncD9c)
- Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations by Obermeyer, Z., Powers, B., et al. Science. 2019. [Available Online](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6464/447.full.pdf)

On Thursday, we'll discuss analytical formulation of policy projects. Distinct from the initial scoping, a true analytical formulation of your policy problem can
only come after you have developed an understanding of the data at hand, which in turn will
often result in a greater understanding of the problem itself. Here, you’ll ask how specifically
your target variable (if relevant) is defined in the data, what types of information are available as predictors, and what baseline you’ll be measure performance  against. Very rarely is the appropriate baseline as simple as "random choice" or the population prevalence. Rather,
it should reflect what would be expected to happen otherwise: perhaps a simple decision rule
that an expert would come up with or even a pre-existing statistical model that the current
effort is seeking to replace.
